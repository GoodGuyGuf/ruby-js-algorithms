# For this challenge, we will be creating two models (Classes)

### The rules for creating those two classes are:

1. Use Instance variables
2. Use at least one Public and one Private Method
3. Use the initialize method to create no blank dice.

# 1. Dice

1. Should have a roll method, which picks a random number from 1-6
1. Should have a method called value which persists the value after each roll

# 2. DiceSet (Contains 2 instances of Dice)

1. Should have a method called: roll -> Which will ROLL BOTH of the dice, where it picks a random number from 1-6.
2. Should have a method called: display -> Which should display both values of the dice. For example, an output of DiceSet.new
3. Should look like this displaying both dice values after they have been rolled: "[1] - ["6]"

# Once you have done that, you will now create a script with:

1. Introduction Text
2. Adding a loop that gets user input
3. Have the user type 'R' to roll again or 'Q' to quit.
